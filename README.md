# Penalty Kick Direction Prediction

## Introduction
This project aims to predict the direction of a football (soccer) penalty kick—**left**, **center**, or **right**—based on the **body language of the shooter** just before ball contact. It uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** trained on labeled video frames. The goal is to support goalkeepers and analysts with an AI-based assistive tool for anticipating shot direction.

Due to the limited availability of labeled real-world penalty footage, the dataset was custom-built and includes video recordings of penalty kicks. The model analyzes pose, leg position, hip rotation, and other physical cues to make predictions.
